1) Makefile related and compilations 
a) Moved functions from ./src/functions/ folder up one directory so that all functions are directly in the ./src/live.c folder.
b) Changed Makefile to include 16 functions. I have commmented out makefile stuff and messed with nothing else.


HEADER FILE REVAMP
2) Header files includes related:
a) changed s_op to be below the t_vm, t_champ, and t_process structs because the function pointer to 16 functions
b) changed ops to be a global variable so that any function can call from anywhere.

3) Functions themselves:

JUMP TABLE IMPLEMENTATION
a) Updated all prototypes in .c files as well as corewar.h so that they all include t_vm, t_champ, and t_process structs.
b) Compiles properly, next step is to confirm whether or not the functions work as intended in virtual memory.

Misc:

	Change the makefile so that it can compile /src/functions into .o files and be able to properly compile all functions.



REVISION
	ERASE TESTING_ENUM in SRC files
