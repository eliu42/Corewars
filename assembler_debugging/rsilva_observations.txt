Notes:

1. IDK if we should check for if .s is at the end of the filename (og_asm does not)

2. It seems our asm cannot overwrite existing files when the og_asm can

3. We give a name size error before the og_asm (from trying to compile with path "~/Downloads/corewar/ressources/zork.s")

4. We give a comment size too big error before the og_asm does (seen when trying to compile run_kitty_RUN.s)

5. The og_asm output permissions are "-rw-------" our asm output permissions are "------r--"

6. The "thi.smightbreak" test case outputs file "thi.corghtbreak" where og_asm outputs file "thi.cor"

7. I tried assembling helltrain.s, it didn't work with the intra's corewar... seems to be a permissions problem, our file is chmod code  '014', the og_asm outputs with '600' (hecktrain.cor is the og_asm version)

8. (Manually changed permissions of helltrain.cor to 600) The behavior is different, our output's version never starts the 'train' part; a diff later showed that the values are not being set properly (see hecktrain.dump, helltrain.dump & train.diff)

9. Still compiles if there is text before the ".name" at the beggining of the file (see zerk.s)

10. Compiled zork.s with our asm and the permissions code was '005' this time, seems rather arbritary...

11. (Manually changed zork.cor permissions to '600') Compiled zork.cor from our asm and og_zork.cor from the og_asm and they were both the same

12. Compiled a file named "s.s.s.s" with our asm and the output was named "s.cor.s", compiled "s.s.s.s" with the og_asm and got the output "s.s.s.cor"

(thi.corghtbreak and zork.cor permissions were changed to 777 in order to be able to push them)
